# EthicalCoder - Open Source AI-Powered IDE

## The Repository

This repository is where **EthicalCoder** is developed by a solo developer passionate about privacy and AI. EthicalCoder is the first privacy-focused AI-powered IDE that doesn't save any user data and only uses locally hosted AI.

## EthicalCoder

**EthicalCoder** combines the simplicity of a code editor with powerful AI-assisted features, all running locally to ensure privacy. It provides intelligent code suggestions, error detection, and debugging tools without sending data to external servers.

EthicalCoder is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. (currently only Windows)
